BUGS:
- Windows dont close when buildings are destroyed
- Windows dont appear when opening in zoomed in mode.
- Mouse moves from window bar when moving windows in zoomed mode
- In zoomed mode there seems to be a lag problem probably associated with repeated transformation
- couple of issues with the start settings leading to some errors when generating the map.
- Low priority: chunks generated while zoomed dont show up until updated
- Bug with plants being removed by removing the block they are attached to and pathfinding
- There seems to be a bug with geenration along chunk borders

NEEDED FEATURES (features that have to be added before the game is complete and playable):
- Allot more recipes --> make a tree of progress using the recipes
- An end goal.
- Some narrative that gives some background to the story
- saving the game
- add settings
- Load and unload chunks when needed and have processes react to that
- allow the game to be paused by pressing space
- add a filter options for the belts for allot better stuff
- allow plants to have berries oid
- add structures while terrain generating
- add ghost buildings when building


SPECIFIC FEATURES:
- Draw air rectangles non-biased towards the y direction.
- Pathfind between chunks before pathfinding trough chunks, this speeds up the pathfinding
- make the camera stop when the loaded area is about to go offscreen instead of allowing to go to the edge
- add a seed feature to the game settings --> low prio

EXTRA FEATURES (features that can be in the game at some point):
- fix all the TODOs
- add numpy arrays for the chunks instead of the current lists of lists --> better memoty efficiency and manipulation
  efficiency presumably --> not completely sure
