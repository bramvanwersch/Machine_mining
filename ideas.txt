BUGS:
- Windows dont close when buildings are destroyed
- Windows dont appear when opening in zoomed in mode.
- Fix blocks getting left behind while mining because of delaye d pathfinding calculations  --> probably fixed no delayed calculations anymore
- There is a rare case where the game crashes when created that has someting to do with pathfinding rectangles not exisitng but still being present in the dictionary.
- The scroll pane does not scroll properly down anymore

NEEDED FEATURES (features that have to be added before the game is complete and playable):
- A nice starting area
- Allot more recipes --> make a tree of progress using the recipes
- An end goal.
- Some narrative that gives some background to the story

SPECIFIC FEATURES:
- add tooltips
- Draw air rectangles non-biased towards the y direction.
- Pathfind between chunks before pathfinding trough chunks, this speeds up the pathfinding
- fix weird movements trough rectangles while pathfinding / fix not always taking the shortest route whit pathfinding


EXTRA FEATURES (features that can be in the game at some point):
- fix all the TODOs
