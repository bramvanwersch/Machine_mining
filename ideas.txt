BUGS:
- Windows dont close when buildings are destroyed
- Windows dont appear when opening in zoomed in mode.
- Mouse moves from window bar when moving windows in zoomed mode
- In zoomed mode there seems to be a lag problem probably associated with repeated transformation
- couple of issues with the start settings leading to some errors when generating the map.

NEEDED FEATURES (features that have to be added before the game is complete and playable):
- Allot more recipes --> make a tree of progress using the recipes
- An end goal.
- Some narrative that gives some background to the story
- saving the game
- add settings
- Load and unload chunks when needed and have processes react to that

SPECIFIC FEATURES:
- Draw air rectangles non-biased towards the y direction.
- Pathfind between chunks before pathfinding trough chunks, this speeds up the pathfinding
- fix weird movements trough rectangles while pathfinding / fix not always taking the shortest route whit pathfinding
- make the camera stop when the loaded area is about to go offscreen instead of allowing to go to the edge
- give blocks a destroy method that defines what items are returned upon destroying

EXTRA FEATURES (features that can be in the game at some point):
- fix all the TODOs
- add numpy arrays for the chunks instead of the current lists of lists
